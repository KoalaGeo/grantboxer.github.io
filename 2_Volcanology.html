	<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
	<br>
	
<p>The subject of diamond geology and volcanology is really challenging - on 
the one side there is the classic De Beers approach of fluidisation and on the 
other is the phreato-magmatists camp initially led by Dr Volker Lorenz. Both 
have their applications and I think in reality both styles exist in nature and 
may occur in the same pipe but at differing times during intrusive events. </p>
<p>Most of my experience relates to the olivine and leucite lamproites of the 
West and East Kimberley of Western Australia (see also my pages on
<a href="argyle.htm">Argyle</a> and
<a href="ellendale.htm">Ellendale</a>). The Argyle pipe is an olivine lamproite diatreme with an age of 
about 1178 Ma and I will present information below to support the 
phreatomagmatic origin of the pipe. The West Kimberley lamproites are all 
relatively new (in Australian geology terms!), with ages of about 20 - 25 Ma, 
and also show many features illustrating the phreatomagmatic nature of these 
pipes (I will add a section on Ellendale in the future).</p>
<p>I spent a number of years while working at the Argyle mine looking at the 
geology and petrography of the pipe. What struck me was the similarity with the 
phreatomagmatic deposits of basaltic volcanics that had been brought to our 
attention by Dr Volker Lorenz. Dr Volker Lorenz was consulting for Argyle at the 
time and brought a wealth of information on basaltic volcanics and the 
phreatomagmatic process. I visited the Tertiary volcanic deposits of Western 
Victoria in south eastern Australia, where exposures were examined and 
photographed. (I hope to be able to put some of these photos on this page in the 
future – the exposures are excellent).</p>
<p>These deposits in Western Victoria were all terrestrial volcanics that had 
been erupted on to dry land (in general). Argyle and these deposits show 
similarities and differences. Phreatomagmatic eruptions occur when hot magma 
(molten rock) comes into contact with water, either as groundwater, lakes or 
oceans. The energy released when the water flashes into steam is enormous and 
very deadly if you happen to be in the immediate area! The results on land are 
usually big holes in the ground!</p>
<p>After the volcanic activity has subsided the craters tend to be filled with 
reworked pyroclastics and crater lake sediments, these features are called maars. 
For more info on these types of features see papers by Lorenz and others, for 
example see Lorenz 
1985 (<a href="Bibliography.html">(Bibliography)</a>) plus numerous other papers since then.</p>
<p>For a discussion of the Argyle pipe see a my paper by Boxer, Lorenz and 
Smith entitled &quot;The Geology and Volcanology of the Argyle (AK1) Lamproite 
Diatreme, Western Australia&quot; which was published by the Geological Society of 
Australia as Special Publication No.14 in 1989. The Special Publication is 
called Kimberlites and Related Rocks and Volume 1 is concerned with &quot;Their 
Composition, Occurrence, Origin and Emplacement&quot; of diamondiferous rocks.&nbsp; These 
are the proceedings of the Fourth International Kimberlite Conference (4thIKC) 
that was held in Perth, WA in 1986.</p>

<h2><a name="Argyle">THE ARGYLE PIPE</a></h2>

<h3>Accretionary Lapilli</h3>

<img src="images/Argyle/Full_AccLapillii_Fig7.jpg"></p>

<p>The photograph above was taken 
in the northern part of the Argyle diatreme and illustrates accretionary lapilli 
in bedded sandy tuffs (quartzose lapilli ash tuffs). The accretionary lapilli 
are classic in structure and are very similar to those found in other wet 
volcanic environments.</p>

<img src="images/Argyle/Full_AccLapilli1.jpg">
 <p>Two issues are of importance here, 1. the eruptions have 
been wet, and 2. the eruptions have to have been subaerial at this time. The 
photo below shows a close up of the accretionary lapilli seen in drill core.</p>

<h3>Drop Stones</h3>

<img src="images/Argyle/Full_AK1_Dropstone.jpg">
<p>The other feature, which proves the subaerial nature of the eruptions at 
the time of formation of the tuffs in the northern part of the diatreme, is the 
occurrence of drop stones. The photo above nicely shows a drop stone in sandy 
tuffs from the northern part of the pipe.&nbsp; This photograph is courtesy of Chris 
Smith (Rio Tinto). </p>

<h3>Internal Pipe Geology</h3>

<p>Meanwhile in the central and southern areas of the pipe, a different 
picture is evident. I logged many kilometres of diamond drill core in an attempt 
to unravel the internal structure of the pipe. A great deal of work was done but 
correlation of the internal geology was very limited and only then with gross 
textural groupings; bedded, ragged or blocky types of textures.</p>
<img src="images/Argyle/Full_Argyle_Bedded_STuffs_Shales.jpg">
<p>At the northern end of the pipe, there were exposures of sandy tuffs 
overlain by fine grained sediments (see photo to left), which were interpreted to 
be crater lake sediments. This would indicate that the northern end of the pipe 
has exposed the highest levels in the diatreme.</p>

<h3>Water Escape Features</h3>

<p>In the northern, an upper parts of the pipe, sandstone dykes cross cut 
the sandy tuffs. These are interpreted to be clastic dykes formed as water 
escape features. They are well documented in sandstone sequences (see
<a href="Bibliography.html">Lowe 1975</a>). I do not know of any other descriptions of clastic dykes in a 
volcanic diamond deposit. Other features that indicate water escape features 
from water saturated volcanoclastics at Argyle include disturbance to bedding 
and entrainment of fine grained ash. The photo on the left indicated the disturbance 
of bedding in tuffaceous sandstone that occurs interbedded with the sandy tuffs 
in the southern part of the Argyle pipe.</p>
<img src="images/Argyle/Full_Argyle_TuffSst.jpg">

<p>The chaotic sandy tuffs at Argyle, which form the majority of the pipe, 
lack any coherent internal structure that can be traced for any significant 
distance. The have the appearance of being mixed and may represent lahar type 
material. They may simply be the result of intense mixing caused by the 
eruptions in the vent and the abundance of water producing a tuffaceous soup.</p>
<img src="images/Argyle/Full_AK1_ChaoticTuff.jpg">

<h3>Juvenile Clasts</h3>
<p>The juvenile clasts in the sandy tuffs of the Argyle pipe comprise two main 
types; blocky” clasts and ragged clasts. Blocky clasts are typically fine 
grained, non-vesicular (in general) and have a predominance of straight faces.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/Argyle/Full_BlockyClast.jpg">

These clasts appear similar to the type 1 clasts of
<a href="Bibliography.html">Wohletz (1983)</a> who states that these types of clasts are the most commonly 
observed shapes in coarse (>63 micron) hydrovolcanic ash.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/Argyle/Full_AK1-RaggedTuff.jpg">
<p>The ragged clasts are generally light coloured, deformed to wispy in shape 
and commonly highly vesicular. The photo below shows a section of core 
comprising ragged tuff.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/Argyle/Full_AK1_RaggedTS.jpg">
<br>
<p>In thin section, the ragged clasts show clear evidence of deformation, as 
shown by these two images. The top image is a polished slab of drill core 
and the other, below, is a thin section showing a ragged clast.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2 name="ArgyleSum">Summary of Observations at the Argyle Pipe</h2>

<p>The overall appearance was one of a chaotic mess. A number of 
petrographic features were relevant to my final interpretation of what had 
happened in the southern area of the pipe.</p>
<p>1. the sandy tuff, which comprises the economically mineralised material, 
is a quartzose lapilli ash tuff. The lapilli are olivine lamproite clasts, which 
are either a massive, fine grained and blocky, type or a flattened vesicular 
type (fiamme – “ragged tuff”) that occur in a matrix of quartz sand grains and 
fine grained ash,</p>
<p>2. the occurrence of accretionary lapilli,</p>
<p>3. tuffaceous sandstone dykes cross cutting the tuffs at various angles 
that appear to be water escape features and due to the dewatering of water 
saturated volcanoclastic sediments,</p>
<p>4. the quartz sand grains in the matrix of the tuffs are largely single 
grains or broken single grains. This contrasts with the sand grains in the host 
rocks, which have been silicified by quartz over-growths.</p>
<p>5. the presence of low-angle cross bedding was suggestive of deposition 
from high energy base surge volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p>Additional photographs of water escape and other features are in the paper 
by Boxer et al mentioned above.</p>

<p>All the evidence points to the fact that the Argyle pipe was intruded into 
a shallow marine environment where there was an abundance of quartz sand and 
water. It is envisaged that the pipe was emplaced on a shallow shelf and that 
sand continually poured into the vent during its formation, allowing deep 
penetration of the sand to great depths in the diatreme.</p>

<p>The water escape features seen in the pipe are represented by sandstone 
dykes and occur in exactly the same way as sandstone dykes in sandy sediments 
and are dewatering features. The occurrence of dropstones and accretionary 
lapilli in the northern part of the diatreme indicated that at later stages in 
the pipe formation, water flow into the vent was restricted, probably by the 
formation of a tuff ring around the vent, and that the non-quartzose lapilli ash 
tuffs (non-sandy tuffs) where probably formed at this time.</p>

<p>At the far northern part of the Argyle pipe, there was an exposure of 
shales (prior to mining) overlying the quartzose lapilli ash tuffs and probably 
represents the deposition of crater lake sediments over the top of the vent. </p>

<img src="images/Volcanology/Full_Sutur.jpg">

<p>The photo left is how I would have imagined the later stages of the Argyle 
eruption to look like. This photo was taken by Dr Volker Lorenz of the Surtur 
eruption near Surtsey in the Atlantic Ocean in 1966.</p>

<p>Note the steam filled eruption cloud and low vent. At Argyle one could 
image many carats of microdiamonds being scattered by the will of the wind!</p>
